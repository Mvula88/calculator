# Dashboard Access Instructions

## For Development (Local Testing)

The dashboard is now accessible in development mode without requiring a payment record.

### To access the dashboard:

1. **Create a new account:**
   - Go to http://localhost:3003/auth/login
   - Click "Don't have an account? Sign up"
   - Use your real email address (you'll need to confirm it)
   - Use a strong password (minimum 6 characters)

2. **Confirm your email:**
   - Check your email inbox
   - Click the confirmation link from Supabase

3. **Access the dashboard:**
   - After confirming, log in at http://localhost:3003/auth/login
   - You'll automatically have access to the dashboard in development mode
   - The payment check is bypassed when NODE_ENV=development

## For Production

In production, users must:
1. Create an account
2. Confirm their email
3. Complete payment through Stripe
4. Only then can they access the dashboard

## Current Status

✅ Dashboard navigation issue is fixed
✅ Development mode bypass is implemented
✅ You can now test the dashboard locally without payment

## Test Credentials

Since email confirmation is required, you need to use a real email address.
The previously created test user email is: testuser@gmail.com (but needs email confirmation)

## Note

The middleware now skips the payment check when `NODE_ENV=development`, which is automatically set when running `npm run dev`.
