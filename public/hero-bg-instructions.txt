HERO BACKGROUND IMAGE INSTRUCTIONS
===================================

To add a hero background image:

1. Add your image to the /public folder with the filename: hero-bg.png
   - Recommended size: 1920x1080 or larger
   - Format: JPG, PNG, or WebP
   - Optimize for web (compress to reduce file size)

2. The image will automatically be used as the hero section background

3. Alternative filenames you can use:
   - hero-bg.png (default)
   - hero-bg.jpg
   - hero-bg.webp

4. To change the filename, edit line 84 in app/page.tsx:
   backgroundImage: 'url(/your-image-name.jpg)'

5. The image will have a semi-transparent overlay for text readability

Recommended image types:
- Cars at a port
- Shipping containers
- Japan auction house
- Highway/road scenes
- Professional automotive imagery

Note: The overlay ensures text remains readable regardless of image brightness.
